This was the result of completing a project on a Udemy bootstrap course. Most of the bootstrap formatting was pretty simple, but I worked with lightbox on this project and had collapsable items on a click function which was new for me. I also started using Font-Awesome a lot more for icons. Also I was working without gutters and trying to give it a sleeker look. The live server page is working perfectly directly form Visual Studio but the live site through GitHub is clunky and slow. The links from my works are pointing correctly but it takes forever to load.
